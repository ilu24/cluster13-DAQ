#### Project and Purpose
Cluster 13 H4O plans to build an autonomous boat that'll tug a buoy along. The buoy will collect data (pH, temperature, tds) using a capsule that'll drop down into the water and send it back to the database via LoRa.

Group 6 DAQ's role in this project is to assure accurate data readings and program the necessary hardware to send capsule data back to the buoy, in order for the buoy to be able to send the data to the database.

#### Github Navigation
- find older codes in the "old" folder, most of these are not being used
- for basic serial communication between two arduinos, check out the arduinomegaserial folder
- basic serial communication between esp 32 and arduino is in esp32-serial folder
- finalized codes are the following files
